Final Goal: Compare 2 datasets of old and new human genome.

Abstract:
The human genome has been updated several times since it was first published, each aiming to improve its completeness and accuracy. 
In this project, we compare an older version of the reference human genome (GRCh38) with a more recent version (T2T-CHM13) to find 
the differences between them, and what genes are being transcripted. Using bioinformatics tools and the data from the UCSC Genome Browser, we can identify regions that are new, missing, or changed in the updated genome. 
Ultimately, the goal is to create a detailed list of these genomic differences and understand what has improved in the newer version. 
This comparison helps us see how the human genome reference continues to evolve over time, especially by filling in regions that were either missing or unclear in the older versions. 
Using outdated genomes can have serious consequences, affecting everything from disease diagnosis to the development of targeted treatments and therapies. 
By recognizing these changes in the human genome, we can improve the accuracy of the analysis in genetics and biomedical research.

Design (Output):
1. High-level genome/gene statistics (e.g., sizes, counts)
2. Region-level BED data (e.g., new or changed genomic regions)

Something like above.

By May 30: Design is due
-> one page long design (professor prefers diagram)
Any idea on this?
