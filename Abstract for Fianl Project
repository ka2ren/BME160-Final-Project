Final Goal: Compare 2 datasets of old and new human genome.

Purpose of comparing 2 old and new genomes?
-> 

Important concepts:
  - Genome is a set of complete DNA, and gene is the functional segments of DNA within the genome. 
  - Human genome (from UCSC browser) refers to the reference genome (not a single individual), which allow researchers to map sequences from different individuals to the reference genome.

Comparing genes within the same genome, we can:
1. Identify gene families, so we can study how new gene functions evolved.
2. To see if genes have overlapping functions, which can compensate for another when it's mutated.
3. Some genes are newly discovered, comparing them to well-known genes helps predict their function.

If we compare GRCh38/hg38 vs T2T CHM13v2.0/hs1:
  - GRCh38/hg38 is the older version of reference human genome.
  - T2T CHM13v2.0/hs1 is the new version of reference human genome, with less gap (or gapless)?
  - Comparing those two we can:
    - See the % accuarcy between those two.
    - How many gaps 

THINGS TO ASK
1. 2 gene datasets in one Genome or compare the old and new genome?
2. What will be the good looking output for this project. Like what kind of looking is good for final.
3. Need to find out how to use UCSC Genome browser


Abstract:
The human genome has been updated several times since it was first published, each aiming to improve its completeness and accuracy. 
In this project, we compare an older version of the reference human genome (GRCh38) with a more recent version (T2T-CHM13) to find 
the differences between them, and what genes are being transcripted. Using bioinformatics tools and the data from the UCSC Genome Browser, we can identify regions that are new, missing, or changed in the updated genome. 
Ultimately, the goal is to create a detailed list of these genomic differences and understand what has improved in the newer version. 
This comparison helps us see how the human genome reference continues to evolve over time, especially by filling in regions that were either missing or unclear in the older versions. 
Using outdated genomes can have serious consequences, affecting everything from disease diagnosis to the development of targeted treatments and therapies. 
By recognizing these changes in the human genome, we can improve the accuracy of the analysis in genetics and biomedical research. 

# I think this is more like an abstract that looks right.
# PLZ add something more or share your thoughts!!

# Heyy, i changed a bit of the abstract to look a little more complete, but feel free to change it. 
# Yo feel free to change anything KW
