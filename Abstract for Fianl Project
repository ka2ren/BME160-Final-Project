Final Goal: Compare 2 datasets of old and new human genome.

Purpose of comparing 2 old and new genomes?
-> 

Important concepts:
  - Genome is a set of complete DNA, and gene is the functional segments of DNA within the genome. 
  - Human genome (from UCSC browser) refers to the reference genome (not a single individual), which allow researchers to map sequences from different individuals to the reference genome.

Comparing genes within the same genome, we can:
1. Identify gene families, so we can study how new gene functions evolved.
2. To see if genes have overlapping functions, which can compensate for another when it's mutated.
3. Some genes are newly discovered, comparing them to well-known genes helps predict their function.

If we compare GRCh38/hg38 vs T2T CHM13v2.0/hs1:
  - GRCh38/hg38 is the older version of reference human genome.
  - T2T CHM13v2.0/hs1 is the new version of reference human genome, with less gap (or gapless)?
  - Comparing those two we can:
    - See the % accuarcy between those two.
    - How many gaps 

THINGS TO ASK
1. 2 gene datasets in one Genome or compare the old and new genome?
2. What will be the good looking output for this project. Like what kind of looking is good for final.
3. Need to find out how to use UCSC Genome browser


Abstract:
The human genome has been updated several times since it was first published. 
In this project, we compare an older version of the human genome (GRCh38) with a newer version (T2T-CHM13) to find 
the differences between them. Using bioinformatics tools, we identify regions that are new, missing, or changed in the updated genome. 
The goal is to create a list of these genomic differences and understand what has improved in the new version. 
This comparison helps us see how the human genome reference is getting more complete over time, 
which is important for future research in genetics and medicine.
# I think this is more like an abstract that looks right.
# PLZ add something more or share your thoughts!!
