Final Goal: Compare 2 datasets of human genome.

Purpose of comparing 2 genes of Datasets?
Comparing 2 genes within the same human genome?

Comparing genes within the same genome, we can:
1. Identify gene families, so we can study how new gene functions evolved.
2. To see if genes have overlapping functions, which can compensate for another when it's mutated.
3. Some genes are newly discovered, comparing them to well-known genes helps predict their function.
