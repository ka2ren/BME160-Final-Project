1. Instead of the entire human genome sequence, we will focus on comparing one chromosome.

From Bernick: Identify telomeres
  - GRCh38 leaves telomeres as long runs of “N”s, so you couldn’t see their true sequence or length. T2T fills in the actual TTAGGG repeat arrays (and their variants). Comparing the two tells you exactly how many repeats were unrepresented before.
  - By counting repeats in T2T vs. counting the gap size in GRCh38, you can now precisely measure telomere length.

Comment from Karen (me):
  - Since the human genome browser has already shown the total length of chromosome, it prob makes more sense to measure the telomere length instead.
  -  We can:
      1. find the N's(gap size) in GRCH38 chromosome, and the repeats in T2T.
      2. By comparing them we can know if the gaps are all filled in T2T, and the accuracy of the telomere length.

Basic code design:
  1. Parse and read the FASTA files we obtained from the UCSC Human Genome Browser.
  2. Detect telomeric sequences (TTAGGG) in the top and bottom strands. 


Project Design 

Project Goal:
The aim of this project is to compare the telomeric regions of the human genome between GRCh38 (the older reference) and T2T-CHM13 (the newer and complete version).
GRCh38, the older reference genome, contains many unresolved regions, particularly in the telomeres which are the long stretches of "N". 
In contrast, the newer T2T-CHM13 (which is Telomere to Telomere) fills in these gaps and includes the full telomeric repeat sequences, like the TTAGGG patterns.
By comparing the complete telomere sequences in T2T-CHM13 to the gaps in GRCh38, we can measure how much information was missing before and learn more about natural differences in telomere length.
# idk we we need prject goal for the design so can can choose if we want to include this or not

Data Source:
The data used in this project comes from the UCSC Genome Browser, which provides access to both the GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13 genome sequences. 
We specifically downloaded the chromosome sequences in FASTA format for both GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13 assemblies.
# Please feel free to add to this

Problem: 
The human reference genome GRCh38 has been the used as the foundation for many genetic studies, diagnostics, and medical treatments. 
However, it still contains many unresolved regions, especially at chromosome ends called telomeres, where there are long stretches of unknown bases (N).
This and complete information could have led to many incorrect conclusions or even flawed treatment based off of incorrect genome data. 
The newer T2T-CHM13 assembly fills in these gaps, providing a complete and accurate picture of telomeric regions. 
While the Genome Browser does provide access to both the genomes and also contains the new and updated telomeric sequences, it does not clearly identify exactly what is new, changed, or even missing compared to the old genome. 
And, ir is very time consuming and challenging to download the full chromosome sequences and perform a comparison between the telomers of the genomes. 
However, this comparison is essential to identify the exact changes between the two genomes since it will help update research, fix any past errors, and also improve medical diagnostics that depend on genome data. 
# I might have been a lil repetitive so feel free to delete or add stuff

Solution: 
In order to solve this problem, we first have to pick one chromosome to focus on. 
Then we download the full sequence of the chromosome from both the genomes and focus on the telomeric regions, which are found at the ends of chromosomes. 
In GRCh38, these regions are often shown as long runs of the letter “N,” which means the actual DNA sequence was unknown or not sequenced properly. 
As stated before, the T2T-CHM13 will contain the full sequence of these regions, including the actual TTAGGG telomeric repeats.
Essentially our code will:
  - Parse and read the FASTA files we obtained from the UCSC Human Genome Browser
  - Identify the telomeric regions at both ends of the chromosomes
  - In GRCh38, locate and measure gaps, by counting the number of missing base pairs in the length of the "N" stretches
  - Detect and counts the number of telomeric repeats (TTAGGG) present in the T2T-CHM13 sequence
  - Compare the length of the telomeric repeats in T2T-CHM13 with the gap sizes in GRCh38 
      ~ This will check if the gaps in GRCh38 are completely filled in the T2T
      ~ Estimate the actual length of the telomeres in the complete genome.
# Can yall double check if i got the code part right, and change it if not
