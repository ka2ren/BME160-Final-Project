1. Instead of the entire human genome sequence, we will focus on comparing one chromosome.

From Bernick: Identify telomeres
  - GRCh38 leaves telomeres as long runs of “N”s, so you couldn’t see their true sequence or length. T2T fills in the actual TTAGGG repeat arrays (and their variants). Comparing the two tells you exactly how many repeats were unrepresented before.
  - By counting repeats in T2T vs. counting the gap size in GRCh38, you can now precisely measure telomere length.

Comment from Karen (me):
  - Since the human genome browser has already shown the total length of chromosome, it prob makes more sense to measure the telomere length instead.
  -  We can:
      1. find the N's(gap size) in GRCH38 chromosome, and the repeats in T2T.
      2. By comparing them we can know if the gaps are all filled in T2T, and the accuracy of the telomere length.

Basic code design:
  1. Parse and read the FASTA files we obtained from the UCSC Human Genome Browser.
  2. Detect telomeric sequences (TTAGGG) in the top and bottom strands.
